# dmmlog

A simple logging manager for your digital multimeter. With this simple script you can send logging commands to your DMM and dump the logs from it.

In the current version it only supports Agilent's U1200 line of multimeters, since the only logging multimeter I own at the time is a U1242B, but I plan on implementing others. If you want your multimeter included in the program please open a Issue.


# Special Thanks

I would like to thank Daniel Nyberg for reverse engineering Agilent's protocol and publishing this [awesome reference](http://ufpr.dl.sourceforge.net/project/dmmutils/Protocol%20reference).
