# dmmlog

A simple logging manager for your digital multimeter. With this simple script you can send commands to your DMM, perform data logging, and dump the logs stored in the device's memory.

## Device Support

**If you want your multimeter included in the program please open a Issue** and if possible provide some resources about the protocol it uses.

  - Agilent U1200 series

## Requirements

To run this application you'll need:

  - Python
  - [pySerial](http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/)

## Special Thanks

I would like to thank Daniel Nyberg for reverse engineering Agilent's protocol and publishing this [awesome reference](http://ufpr.dl.sourceforge.net/project/dmmutils/Protocol%20reference).
